# xSDK Community Policy Compatibility for STRUMPACK

This document summarizes the efforts of current and future xSDK packages to achieve compatibility with the xSDK community policies. Below only short descriptions of each policy are provided. The full description is available [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DCx2Duijb0COESCuxwEEK1j0BPe2cTIJ-AjtJxt3290/edit#heading=h.2hp5zbf0n3o3)
and should be considered when filling out this form.

Please, provide information on your compatibility status for each mandatory policy, and if possible also for recommended policies. If you are not compatible, state what is lacking and what are your plans on how to achieve compliance. For current xSDK packages: If you were not compliant at some point, please describe the steps you undertook to fulfill the policy. This information will be helpful for future xSDK packages.

An xSDK compatible package is considered to be a member package if it uses, or can be used by another package in the xSDK.

**Member:** yes

### Mandatory Policies

| Policy                 |Support| Notes                   |
|------------------------|-------|-------------------------|
|**M1.** Support portable installation through Spack. |Full| STRUMPACK uses CMake and can be installed with `spack install strumpack`. |
|**M2.** Provide a comprehensive test suite for correctness of installation verification. |Full| STRUMPACK utilizes CTest to run a set of regression tests using the 'make test' command after building. |
|**M3.** Employ userprovided MPI communicator (no MPI_COMM_WORLD). Don't assume a full MPI 3 implementation without checking. Provide an option to prevent any changes to MPI error-handling if it is changed by default. |Full| None. |
|**M4.** Give best effort at portability to key architectures (standard Linux distributions, GNU, Clang, vendor compilers, and target machines at ALCF, NERSC, OLCF). |Full| We mostly test on GNU and Intel compilers on Linux, Mac and NERSC. |
|**M5.** Provide a documented, reliable way to contact the development team. |Full| Developers can be contacted directly, issues can be reported on GitHub. |
|**M6.** Respect system resources and settings made by other previously called packages (e.g. signal handling). |Full| None. |
|**M7.** Come with an open source (BSD style) license. |Full| STRUMPACK uses the 3-clause BSD license. |
|**M8.** Provide a runtime API to return the current version number of the software. |Full| None. |
|**M9.** Use a limited and well-defined symbol, macro, library, and include file name space. |Full| Everything is included in the (C++) strumpack namespace. Headers are organized in subfolders. |
|**M10.** Provide an xSDK team accessible repository (not necessarily publicly available). |Full| Open GitHub repo: https://github.com/pghysels/STRUMPACK |
|**M11.** Have no hardwired print or IO statements that cannot be turned off. |Full| Some warning messages are printed to sterr. |
|**M12.** For external dependencies, allow installing, building, and linking against an outside copy of external software. |Full| No libraries are bundled with STRUMPACK. External dependencies are METIS, BLAS, LAPACK (required), and optional: ScaLAPACK/BLACS, ParMETIS, (PT)Scotch, ZFP, SLATE, CUDA, ROCm, ... |
|**M13.** Install headers and libraries under \<prefix\>/include and \<prefix\>/lib. |Full| CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=directory. |
|**M14.** Be buildable using 64 bit pointers. 32 bit is optional. |Full| Packages supports both 32 and 64 bit under same API. |
|**M15.** All xSDK compatibility changes should be sustainable. |Full| None. |
|**M16.** Any xSDK-compatible package that compiles code should have a configuration option to build in Debug mode.. |Full| STRUMPACK can be installed in debug mode via spack with the build_type=Debug variant. |

**M1 details:**:

All STRUMPACK features are configurable through spack variants, including CUDA and HIP/ROCm support. For example, for CUDA-enabled STRUMPACK one can do `spack install strumpack+cuda`, or for HIP/ROCm, `spack install strumpack+rocm`.



### Recommended Policies

| Policy                 |Support| Notes                   |
|------------------------|-------|-------------------------|
|**R1.** Have a public repository. |Full| https://github.com/pghysels/STRUMPACK. |
|**R2.** Possible to run test suite under valgrind in order to test for memory corruption issues. |No| We plan to update the test suite to allow for automatically running tests under valgrind. |
|**R3.** Adopt and document consistent system for error conditions/exceptions. |Partial| This needs some improvement. Exceptions are used in some places, error codes in other places. |
|**R4.** Free all system resources acquired as soon as they are no longer needed. |Full| C++ destructors clean up any allocated resources. C API is available too. |
|**R5.** Provide a mechanism to export ordered list of library dependencies. |Full| STRUMPACK exports a CMake config file which details library dependencies. |
|**R6.** Document versions of packages that it works with or depends upon, preferably in machine-readable form.  |Partial| The STRUMPACK documentation has some information. Version conflicts are also part of the spack installation script. |
|**R7.** Have README, SUPPORT, LICENSE, and CHANGELOG files in top directory.  |Partial| STRUMPACK has a README and LICENSE file. |
|**R8.** Each xSDK package should have sufficient documentation to support use and further development. |Full| STRUMPACK has extensive user documentation with examples. |
