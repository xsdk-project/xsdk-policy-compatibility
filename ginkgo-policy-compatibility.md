# xSDK Community Policy Compatibility for Ginkgo

This document summarizes the efforts of current and future xSDK packages to achieve compatibility with the xSDK community policies. Below only short descriptions of each policy are provided. The full description is available [here](https://github.com/xsdk-project/xsdk-community-policies)
and should be considered when filling out this form.

Please, provide information on your compability status for each mandatory policy, and if possible also for recommended policies.
If you are not compatible, state what is lacking and what are your plans on how to achieve compliance.

For current xSDK packages: If you were not fully compatible at some point, please describe the steps you undertook to fulfill the policy. This information will be helpful for future xSDK packages.

An xSDK compatible package is considered to be a member package if it uses, or can be used by another package in the xSDK.

**Website:** [ginkgo-project.github.io](https://ginkgo-project.github.io/)

**Member:** yes

### Mandatory Policies

| Policy                 |Support| Notes                   |
|------------------------|-------|-------------------------|
|**M1.** Support portable installation through Spack. |Full| *Ginkgo* supports and provides a Spack package. |
|**M2.** Provide a comprehensive test suite for correctness of installation verification. |Full| Ginkgo contains a comprehensive set of unit tests which can be run individually, or all at once via CTest. In addition, `make test_install` can be ran and is used in `spack` to ensure the correctness of the installation.|
|**M3.** Employ user-provided MPI communicator (no MPI_COMM_WORLD). |Full| None. |
|**M4.** Give best effort at portability to key architectures (standard Linux distributions, GNU, Clang, vendor compilers, and target machines at ALCF, NERSC, OLCF). |Full| Ginkgo supports any C++14 compliant compiler. Compatibility with the newest versions of GNU, Clang and vendor compilers is automatically verified via CI. |
|**M5.** Provide a documented, reliable way to contact the development team. |Full| The developers can be contacted via [github issues](https://github.com/ginkgo-project/ginkgo/issues) or through the ginkgo.library@gmail.com address. |
|**M6.** Respect system resources and settings made by other previously called packages (e.g. signal handling). |Full| None. |
|**M7.** Come with an open source (BSD style) license. |Full|  Ginkgo uses the 3-clause BSD license. |
|**M8.** Provide a runtime API to return the current version number of the software. |Full| Ginkgo provides the `gko::version_info` class which can be used to query version details. |
|**M9.** Use a limited and well-defined symbol, macro, library, and include file name space. |Full| All ginkgo functions and classes are in the `gko::` namespace. All macros have a `GKO_` prefix. All header files are installed in the `ginkgo/` subidrectory. All libraries have a `ginkgo` prefix.|
|**M10.** Provide an xSDK team accessible repository (not necessarily publicly available). |Full| [ginkgo-project/ginkgo](https://github.com/ginkgo-project/ginkgo). |
|**M11.** Have no hardwired print or IO statements that cannot be turned off. |Full| Everything is handled through exceptions or the user controlled `gko::Log` class. A few direct IO statements are used in case of important failure and can be disabled at compile time. |
|**M12.** For external dependencies, allow installing, building, and linking against an outside copy of external software. |Full| Done through CMake's `find_package`. By default, Ginkgo uses its own version of the subpackages but this behavior can be overridden with a CMake option. |
|**M13.** Install headers and libraries under \<prefix\>/include and \<prefix\>/lib. |Full| We use the standard `CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX` option. |
|**M14.** Be buildable using 64 bit pointers. 32 bit is optional. |Full| Ginkgo supports both 32 and 64 bit under the same API. |
|**M15.** All xSDK compatibility changes should be sustainable. |Full| Ginkgo aims to be fully xSDK compatible with its first 1.0.0 release. |
|**M16.** Any xSDK-compatible package that compiles code should have a configuration option to build in Debug mode. |Full| Ginkgo activates its debug features through the standard `-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug` option. |


### Recommended Policies

| Policy                 |Support| Notes                   |
|------------------------|-------|-------------------------|
|**R1.** Have a public repository. |Full| [ginkgo-project/ginkgo](https://github.com/ginkgo-project/ginkgo) |
|**R2.** Possible to run test suite under valgrind in order to test for memory corruption issues. |Full| Ginkgo uses CTest which has this feature. A suppressions list is also provided for convenience. We also facilitate running our software and tests using memory sanitizers, cuda-memcheck, etc. |
|**R3.** Adopt and document consistent system for error conditions/exceptions. |Full| Ginkgo reports errors through exceptions inherited from `std::exception`. |
|**R4.** Free all system resources acquired as soon as they are no longer needed. |Full| None. |
|**R5.** Provide a mechanism to export ordered list of library dependencies. |Full| This information is available through a pkg-config file and the CMake exported targets. |
|**R6.** Document versions of packages that it works with or depends upon, preferably in machine-readable form.  |Partial|This is documented in our main `README.md`, but currently not in a machine readable form. | 
|**R7.** Have README, SUPPORT, LICENSE, and CHANGELOG files in top directory.  |Full | Ginkgo provides `README.md`, `LICENSE` and `CHANGELOG.md` files. Support information is available as part of the `README.md`. |
|**R8.** Each xSDK package should have sufficient documentation to support use and further development.  |Full| Full documentation can be found both in user and developer mode. A series of tutorial and many examples are available for using Ginkgo. We have specific guidelines and tutorials for future developers as well (for example, regarding important C++ aspects). |
