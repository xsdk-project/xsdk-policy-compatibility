# xSDK Community Policy Compatibility for \<package\>

This document summarizes the efforts of current and future xSDK packages to achieve compatibility with the xSDK community policies version 1.0.0. Below only short descriptions of each policy are provided. The full description is available [here](https://github.com/xsdk-project/xsdk-community-policies)
and should be considered when filling out this form.

*** A good example of how to complete this form can be found in the [hypre version](https://github.com/xsdk-project/xsdk-policy-compatibility/blob/master/hypre-policy-compatibility.md).

Please, provide information on your compability status for each mandatory policy, and if possible also for recommended policies.
If you are not compatible, state what is lacking and what are your plans on how to achieve compliance.

For current xSDK packages: If you were not fully compatible at some point, please describe the steps you undertook to fulfill the policy. This information will be helpful for future xSDK packages.

An xSDK compatible package is considered to be a member package if it uses, or can be used by another package in the xSDK.

| Policy                 |Support| Notes                   |
|------------------------|-------|-------------------------|
|**M1.** Support portable installation through Spack. |Full/Partial/None| Short-expanation-here; optional link for more extensive details if needed, see below. [M1 details](#m1-details)|
|**M2.** Provide a comprehensive test suite for correctness of installation verification. |Full/Partial/None| Short-expanation-here; optional link for more extensive details if needed, see below. [M2 details](#m2-details)|

|**M5.** Provide a documented, reliable way to contact the development team. |Full/Partial/None| None. |
|**M6.** Respect system resources and settings made by other previously called packages (e.g. signal handling). |Full/Partial/None| None. |
|**M7.** Come with an open source (BSD style) license. |Full/Partial/None| Use 2-clause BSD license. |
|**M8.** Provide a runtime API to return the current version number of the software. |Full/Partial/None| None. |
|**M9.** Use a limited and well-defined symbol, macro, library, and include file name space. |Full/Partial/None| None. |
|**M10.** Provide a publicly available repository. |Full/Partial/None| Repo is access controlled but available as release tarfile. |
|**M11.** Have no hardwired print or IO statements that cannot be turned off. |Full/Partial/None| None. |
|**M12.** For external dependencies, allow installing, building, and linking against an outside copy of external software. |Full/Partial/None| None. |
|**M13.** Install headers and libraries under \<prefix\>/include and \<prefix\>/lib. |Full/Partial/None| None. |
|**M14.** Be buildable using 64 bit pointers. 32 bit is optional. |Full/Partial/None| Package supports both 32 and 64 bit under same API. |
|**M15.** All xSDK compatibility changes should be sustainable. |Full/Partial/None| None. |
|**M16.** Have a debug build option. |Full/Partial/None| None. |
|**M17.** Each xSDK package should have sufficient documentation to support use and further development.  |Full/Partial/None| While documentation for users is mandatory, developer documentation is recommended, but not yet required. |

M1 details <a id="m1-details"></a>: optional: provide more details about approach to addressing topic M1.
