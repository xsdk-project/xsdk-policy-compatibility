# xSDK Community Policy Compatibility for preCICE

This document summarizes the efforts of current and future xSDK packages to achieve compatibility with the xSDK community policies. Below only short descriptions of each policy are provided. The full description is available [here](https://github.com/xsdk-project/xsdk-community-policies)
and should be considered when filling out this form.

Please, provide information on your compability status for each mandatory policy, and if possible also for recommended policies.
If you are not compatible, state what is lacking and what are your plans on how to achieve compliance.

For current xSDK packages: If you were not fully compatible at some point, please describe the steps you undertook to fulfill the policy. This information will be helpful for future xSDK packages.

An xSDK compatible package is considered to be a member package if it uses, or can be used by another package in the xSDK.

**Member:** yes

### Mandatory Policies

| Policy                 |Support| Notes                   |
|------------------------|-------|-------------------------|
|**M1.** Support portable installation through Spack. |Full| The precice Spack package is maintained directly by the preCICE team.
|**M2.** Provide a comprehensive test suite for correctness of installation verification. |Full| preCICE has an extensive test suite consisting of traditional unit tests, and integration tests based on MPI. We also run system tests to test provided adapters and perform numerical validation. [Read more](https://precice.org/installation-source-testing) preCICE also supports [smoke tests](https://precice.org/installation-source-installation).
|**M3.** Employ user-provided MPI communicator (no MPI_COMM_WORLD). Don't assume a full MPI 3 implementation without checking. Provide an option to prevent any changes to MPI error-handling if it is changed by default. |Full| One can pass a custom communicator to each `precice::SolverInterface`. |
|**M4.** Give best effort at portability to key architectures (standard Linux distributions, GNU, Clang, vendor compilers, and target machines at ALCF, NERSC, OLCF). |Full| preCICE is tested with gcc and clang as well as OpenMPI and MPICH. It is used on a wide variety of distributions and architectures and we [maintain general information](https://precice.org/installation-overview) as well as guides for [relevant HPC systems](https://precice.org/installation-special-systems). |
|**M5.** Provide a documented, reliable way to contact the development team. |Full| We provide support via [GitHub](https://github.com/precice/precice/issues), [Gitter chat](https://gitter.im/precice/Lobby) and our [discourse forum](https://precice.discourse.group). |
|**M6.** Respect system resources and settings made by other previously called packages (e.g. signal handling). |Full| No signal handlers past 1.5.2 |
|**M7.** Come with an open source (BSD style) license. |Full| preCICE is licensed under the LGPLv3 license |
|**M8.** Provide a runtime API to return the current version number of the software. |Full| `precice::getVersionInformation()` |
|**M9.** Use a limited and well-defined symbol, macro, library, and include file name space. |Full| Symbol namespace is `precice::`. Include namespace is `precice/`. Macro prefix is `PRECICE_`. |
|**M10.** Provide an xSDK team accessible repository (not necessarily publicly available). |Full| Our code is hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/precice/precice) |
|**M11.** Have no hardwired print or IO statements that cannot be turned off. |Full| The library provides log configuration via the main XML configuration file and an easy-to-generate `log.conf`. [Read more](https://precice.org/configuration-logging) |
|**M12.** For external dependencies, allow installing, building, and linking against an outside copy of external software. |Full| preCICE internally uses `nlohmann/json` and `fmtlib`. |
|**M13.** Install headers and libraries under \<prefix\>/include and \<prefix\>/lib. |Full| preCICE respects the `CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX`. |
|**M14.** Be buildable using 64 bit pointers. 32 bit is optional. |Full| preCICE always uses the native pointer size. |
|**M15.** All xSDK compatibility changes should be sustainable. |Full| All policies are part of the normal releases. |
|**M16.** Any xSDK-compatible package that compiles code should have a configuration option to build in Debug mode. |Full| Supports `CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE` |

### Recommended Policies

| Policy                 |Support| Notes                   |
|------------------------|-------|-------------------------|
|**R1.** Have a public repository. |Full| [GitHub](https://github.com/precice/precice) |
|**R2.** Possible to run test suite under valgrind in order to test for memory corruption issues. |Full| Yes |
|**R3.** Adopt and document consistent system for error conditions/exceptions. |Partial| [Work in progress!](https://github.com/precice/precice/issues/280) We have strong culture of using assertions. |
|**R4.** Free all system resources acquired as soon as they are no longer needed. |Full| Yes and we constantly improve the resource management through modernization, clang-tidy, sanitizers and valgrind/heaptrack and code reviews. |
|**R5.** Provide a mechanism to export ordered list of library dependencies. |None| |
|**R6.** Document versions of packages that it works with or depends upon, preferably in machine-readable form.  |Full| Spack can be used to generate this graph. |
|**R7.** Have README, SUPPORT, LICENSE, and CHANGELOG files in top directory.  |Partial| Work in Progress |
|**R8.** Each xSDK package should have sufficient documentation to support use and further development.  |None| preCICE provides an extensive user documentation [precice.org/docs](https://precice.org/docs). |
