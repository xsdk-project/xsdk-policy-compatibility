# xSDK Community Policy Compatibility for PETSc

This document summarizes the efforts of current and future xSDK packages to achieve compatibility with the xSDK community policies. Below only short descriptions of each policy are provided. The full description is available [here](https://github.com/xsdk-project/xsdk-community-policies)
and should be considered when filling out this form.

*** A good example of how to complete this form can be found in the [PETSc version](https://github.com/xsdk-project/xsdk-policy-compatibility/blob/master/petsc-policy-compatibility.md).

Please, provide information on your compability status for each mandatory policy, and if possible also for recommended policies.
If you are not compatible, state what is lacking and what are your plans on how to achieve compliance.

For current xSDK packages: If you were not fully compatible at some point, please describe the steps you undertook to fulfill the policy. This information will be helpful for future xSDK packages.

An xSDK compatible package is considered to be a member package if it uses, or can be used by another package in the xSDK.

**Member:** yes

### Mandatory Policies

| Policy                 |Support| Notes                   |
|------------------------|-------|-------------------------|
|**M1.** Support portable installation through Spack. |Full| PETSc is installable via `spack install petsc`. It uses buildtools implemented in python that provide GNU Autoconf interface|
|**M2.** Provide a comprehensive test suite for correctness of installation verification. |Full| PETSc has over 1000 test examples and a test harness that can execute the examples in parallel. And they are run as part of CI (https://gitlab.com/petsc/petsc/-/pipelines)|
|**M3.** Employ user-provided MPI communicator (no MPI_COMM_WORLD). Don't assume a full MPI 3 implementation without checking. Provide an option to prevent any changes to MPI error-handling if it is changed by default. |Full| All PETSc objects take a MPI communicator in the constructor, allowing the user complete control over where each object exists and performs its computations. And configure checks for MPI3 functionality - before enabling use in the library |
|**M4.** Give best effort at portability to key architectures (standard Linux distributions, GNU, Clang, vendor compilers, and target machines at ALCF, NERSC, OLCF). |Full| The PETSc test suite tests all major compilers and several minor ones, including solaris, PGI, Windows.|
|**M5.** Provide a documented, reliable way to contact the development team. |Full| PETSc developers can be contacted via issues on GitLab (https://gitlab.com/petsc/petsc/-/issues) or via email to petsc-maint@mcs.anl.gov.|
|**M6.** Respect system resources and settings made by other previously called packages (e.g. signal handling). |Full| Although by default PETSc attaches its own set of signal handlers, the appropriate function call <tt>PetscOptionsSetValue("-no_signal_handler","true")</tt> before calling <ttt>PetscInitialize()</tt> leaves the current signal handler in place.  |
|**M7.** Come with an open source (BSD style) license. |Full| Use 2-clause BSD license. |
|**M8.** Provide a runtime API to return the current version number of the software. |Full| <tt>PetscGetVersion()</tt> and <tt>PetscGetVersionNumber()</tt> |
|**M9.** Use a limited and well-defined symbol, macro, library, and include file name space. |Full| PETSc include files all begin with <tt>petsc</tt>. The libraries begin with <tt>libpetsc</tt>. Macros and symbols begin with <tt>PETSc</tt> or a small set of other prefixes. The symbol/macro space is larger than it should be since it has prefixes such as <tt>Vec</tt>, <tt>Mat</tt>, <tt>KSP</tt>. These have not been removed since it would require changes to all PETSc codes. Surprisingly we have not had reports of symbol conflicts, which is why we have not fixed this potential problem. |
|**M10.** Provide an xSDK team accessible repository (not necessarily publicly available). |Full| [https://gitlab.com/petsc/petsc](https://gitlab.com/petsc/petsc) |
|**M11.** Have no hardwired print or IO statements that cannot be turned off. |Full| All of PETSc's I/O can be turned of at runtime. In addition, one can provide a file pointer to have ASCII output saved to a file instead of stdout/stderr or provide a function pointer that gives the user complete control on how ASCII output is handled. For example, in GUI systems such as Microsoft Windows, one can have the text appear in popup windows if desired. |
|**M12.** For external dependencies, allow installing, building, and linking against an outside copy of external software. |Full| For each external package xxx, PETSc supports both the configure option <tt>--with-xxx-dir</tt> to use an externally built version and <tt>--download-xxx</tt> to install the package. PETSc does not contain any other package's source code within  |
|**M13.** Install headers and libraries under \<prefix\>/include and \<prefix\>/lib. |Full| PETSc's configure uses the usual <tt>--prefix</tt> option. |
|**M14.** Be buildable using 64 bit pointers. 32 bit is optional. |Full| Packages supports both 32 and 64 bit under same API. |
|**M15.** All xSDK compatibility changes should be sustainable. |Full| Rather than providing the xSDK options as add ons, we have incorporated them fully into the basic PETSc infrastructure, so that xSDK options get the same maintaince and support as any other feature of PETSc.  |
|**M16.** Any xSDK-compatible package that compiles code should have a configuration option to build in Debug mode. |Full| PETSc's configure uses --with-debugging=0/1 option. |

M1 details <a id="m1-details"></a>: optional: provide more details about approach to addressing topic M1.

M2 details <a id="m2-details"></a>: optional: provide more details about approach to addressing topic M2.

### Recommended Policies

| Policy                 |Support| Notes                   |
|------------------------|-------|-------------------------|
|**R1.** Have a public repository. |Full| [https://gitlab.com/petsc/petsc](https://gitlab.com/petsc/petsc) |
|**R2.** Possible to run test suite under valgrind in order to test for memory corruption issues. |Full| PETSc has this capacity and runs the test suite under valgrind for CI |
|**R3.** Adopt and document consistent system for error conditions/exceptions. |Full| PETSc uses error codes from Fortran and C/C++ to report all error conditions. After each function is called the error code is checked to determine whether the code can continue or must be terminated. It uses this checking to produce stack traces by default when errors are detected. |
|**R4.** Free all system resources acquired as soon as they are no longer needed. |Full| PETSc tests use valgrind, MPICH options, and internal code to report any resources or memory that are not freed before the program completes. |
|**R5.** Provide a mechanism to export ordered list of library dependencies. |Full| The command <tt>make getlinklibs</tt> lists all dependencies for an install; PETSc also provides pkgconfig and module files.
|**R6.** Document versions of packages that it works with or depends upon, preferably in machine-readable form.  |Partial| This is curently documented in configure - which checks for compatilbe versions of packages as needed |
|**R7.** Have README, SUPPORT, LICENSE, and CHANGELOG files in top directory.  |Full| . Provides [README](https://gitlab.com/petsc/petsc/-/blob/main/README.md), [CONTRIBUTING](https://gitlab.com/petsc/petsc/-/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING), [LICENSE](https://gitlab.com/petsc/petsc/-/blob/main/LICENSE), [CODE_OF_CONDUCT](https://gitlab.com/petsc/petsc/-/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) in repo and [CHANGES](https://petsc.org/release/docs/changes) |
|**R8.** Each xSDK package should have sufficient documentation to support use and further development.  |Full| [Developer document](https://petsc.org/release/developers/) |
